# Phase 3: Storage and Database Implementation (1-2 weeks)

## Overview
This phase involves setting up local storage for book PDF files and implementing a database to manage book information. The goal is to establish a robust backend infrastructure that supports efficient data retrieval and file management.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Local Storage Setup
- **Create Storage Directory**
  - Set up a dedicated directory within the project structure to store PDF files.
  - Ensure the directory is included in the `.gitignore` file to prevent large files from being tracked.

- **File Organization System**
  - Organize files by categories or authors to facilitate easy access and management.
  - Implement a naming convention for files to avoid conflicts.


### 2. Database Implementation
- **Design Database Schema**
  - Define tables for books, categories, authors, reviews, and file metadata.
  - Ensure each table has appropriate fields and relationships.

- **Set Up SQLite Database**
  - Install SQLite and configure it within the project.
  - Create a database connection in the application code.

- **Implement Database Models**
  - Use an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy) to define models for each table.
  - Implement migrations to manage schema changes.

- **Database Operations**
  - Develop CRUD operations for managing book records.
  - Optimize queries for performance and scalability.
  - Implement search indexing to enhance query efficiency.

### 3. API Development
- **Create RESTful Endpoints**
  - Develop endpoints for retrieving book information and accessing PDF files.
  - Implement search and filter queries to support frontend functionality.

- **File Serving System**
  - Set up a secure method for serving PDF files to users.
  - Ensure file paths are correctly managed and protected.

- **Security Measures**
  - Implement access control to restrict file and data access.
  - Add file download protection to prevent unauthorized distribution.
  - Use rate limiting to mitigate abuse of the API.

## Conclusion
This phase will lay the groundwork for a scalable and secure backend system, enabling efficient management of book data and files. Ensure thorough testing of all components before proceeding to the next phase.
