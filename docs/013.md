## Overall Goal

The aim is to create a smaller, more compact book card that feels proportional to the 200×300 cover image. By reducing excess whitespace and adjusting typography, the card will feel more balanced, visually appealing, and aligned with the image dimensions. The result should be a neater, more elegant card that places the book cover at the forefront while still providing key book details in a readable format.

## Areas for Improvement and Suggestions

### 1. Adjust Card Dimensions and Spacing

**Problem:** The current card size and spacing may be larger than necessary, making the card feel less streamlined and not well-proportioned to the image.

**What to do:**
- Set the card’s width slightly larger than the image (e.g., 220–240px) so the cover remains the main visual element and the text aligns neatly below it.  
- Reduce internal padding so that the title, author, and rating fit snugly under the image, eliminating excess empty space.

**Example CSS:**
```css
.book-card {
  width: 240px;     /* Slightly wider than the 200px image width */
  padding: 12px;     /* Reduced padding for a more compact feel */
  border-radius: 6px;
  background: #fff;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### 2. Harmonize Typography and Line Spacing

**Problem:** Large fonts and generous line spacing can make the card look oversized relative to the image.

**What to do:**
- Slightly reduce font sizes for the title, author, and description.  
- Adjust line spacing (e.g., `line-height`) to be more compact, ensuring that text does not dominate the card’s vertical space.

**Example CSS:**
```css
.book-card h3 {
  font-size: 1.1rem;  /* Slightly smaller than before */
  font-weight: 600;
  margin-bottom: 4px; 
}

.book-card .author {
  font-size: 0.9rem;
  color: #666;
  margin-bottom: 4px;
  line-height: 1.2;
}

.book-card .description {
  font-size: 0.85rem;
  color: #555;
  margin-bottom: 6px;
  line-height: 1.3;
}
```

### 3. Keep the Image as a Focal Point

**Problem:** The card should highlight the cover image. A compact layout means the image stands out immediately without the text competing for attention.

**What to do:**
- Ensure the image remains 200×300 and centered.  
- Place the image at the top of the card with a small margin-bottom to neatly separate it from the text elements.

**Example CSS:**
```css
.book-card img {
  width: 200px;
  height: 300px;
  object-fit: cover;
  border-radius: 4px;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto 8px auto; /* Centered and small gap before text */
}
```

### 4. Tags and Buttons in a Tight Space

**Problem:** Tags and action buttons should fit neatly at the bottom without making the card feel cluttered.

**What to do:**
- Use smaller font sizes and tighter margins on tags so they occupy minimal space.  
- Align “View Details” and “Download” buttons horizontally, ensuring they fit within the card’s limited width without crowding.

**Example CSS:**
```css
.tag {
  background: #e9ecef;
  color: #333;
  font-size: 0.75rem;
  padding: 3px 6px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  margin: 2px 4px 0 0;
}

.book-card .actions {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  margin-top: auto;
}

.book-card .actions a.button {
  font-size: 0.85rem;
  padding: 6px 8px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background: #0275d8;
  color: #fff;
  text-decoration: none;
  text-align: center;
}

.book-card .actions a.button:hover {
  background: #025aa5;
}
```

### 5. Test Responsive Adjustments

**Problem:** On smaller screens, the narrower cards should still look good.

**What to do:**
- Since the card is already small, it may not need significant changes on mobile.  
- Just ensure that at very narrow widths, the card stacks nicely, and text remains legible.

**Example CSS:**
```css
@media (max-width: 500px) {
  .book-card {
    width: 95%;    /* Use almost full width on small screens for better readability */
    max-width: 240px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
}
```
